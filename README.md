## Hello there

My name is Britton, nice to meet you! I'm a Seattle/Tacoma based digital designer and front-end developer that's passionate about marketing and branding. I bring design, development, and marketing together to create engaging customer experiences.


## About me

I graduated from the University of Washington with a Bachelors Degree in Business Administration, with a focus on marketing. I've also taken a couple years worth of computer science classes specializing in both Python and Java. However, I tend to do the majority of my development work in javascript.

When I'm not working on creative designs or development work, you'll probably find me working on creative music mixes. Ever since I was a kid, I've always wanted to be a DJ. I looked up to artists such as Daft Punk, Calvin Harris, and Afrojack. You can find music mixes I've put together over at <a href="https://hearthis.at/blorentz" target="_blank">hearthis.at/blorentz.</a>

One of my favorite things to do with my free time is travel. You'll usually find me in either Las Vegas or San Francisco when I get the need to do some traveling. Some destinations on my bucket list include England, Italy, and Germany. 

One fun fact about me: my sport of choice was racing when I was a kid. I started out racing karts at 12 years old, and quickly moved into mini sprints, sprint cars, and stock cars. I've been fortunate enough to win some major events, such as the <a href="https://youtu.be/gNB4Y1Z9wD0" target="_blank">karting grand nationals.</a> I've also been invited to try out for the Red Bull Driver Search when I was 15 years old. There's still an old archive of some of my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCfuPhav3tG0bxt_9u_Yc-MRXNOYCP-yp" target="_blank">best races on YouTube.</a>
